# LangChain_Project

LangChain - LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models.

Language learning Model - A large language model (LLM) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that uses deep learning techniques and massively large data sets to understand, summarize, generate and predict new content. The term generative AI also is closely connected with LLMs, which are, in fact, a type of generative AI that has been specifically architected to help generate text-based content.

Models - LangChain provides standard, extendable interfaces and external integrations for the following modules, listed from least to most complex:
      Model I/O
      Interface with language models
      
      Retrieval
      Interface with application-specific data
      
      Chains
      Construct sequences of calls
      
      Agents
      Let chains choose which tools to use given high-level directives
      
      Memory
      Persist application state between runs of a chain
      
      Callbacks
      Log and stream intermediate steps of any chain

Datasets - The term data set refers to a file that contains one or more records. The record is the basic unit of information used by a program running on z/OS. Any named group of records is called a data set.

Text Generation - Text generation is a process where an AI system produces written content, imitating human language patterns and styles. The process involves generating coherent and meaningful text that resembles natural human communication.

Text to Image Generation - Text-to-image models generally combine a language model, which transforms the input text into a latent representation, and a generative image model, which produces an image conditioned on that representation.

LLMA-index - LlamaIndex provides a complete toolkit to build language-based applications. On top of that, you can use various data loaders and agent tools from Llama Hub to develop complex applications with multiple functionalities. You can connect custom data sources to your LLM with one or more plugins Data Loaders.
